## Description
A project/personal info portfolio page was set up to present all the projects that Jean will complete in CSCI E-15 course.
Git, Github and Digital Ocean server were applied in the project.
HTML and CSS skills were used with Bootstrap front-end framework technology.

## Demo
Not applicable in this project.

## Details for teaching team
The file `index.php` was used to generate a portfolio page.
No login required.
Since index.php is the default page shown in the document directory, users can see the portfoli page upon browsing the subdomain.
A favicon.ico from my own website was used on the project directory to override the default favicon on the browser page.

## Outside code
* Bootstrap: http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/
